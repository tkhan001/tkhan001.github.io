## Work Experience
**Graduate Research Assistant @ UMD Francis Lab (_August 2022 - Present_)**
- Spearheaded data curation efforts, collecting and organizing large-scale datasets related to neurological behaviors in mice.
- Implemented a supervised machine learning model, achieving an accuracy rate of 92%, to extrapolate mouse behavior from the collected data.
- Presented research findings at a UMD seminar, garnering recognition for "Analyzing Social Behaviors in a Mouse Model of Autism using Neural Networks."


## Projects
**Machine Translation Model (_March 2022_)**
- Developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model in Python using scikit-learn, achieving a BLEU score of 0.85 for English-to-French translation.
- Analyzed training data to understand the nuances of creating and decoding a seq2seq machine translation model using a GRU-based encoder-decoder architecture.
-  Utilized TensorFlow and PyTorch to implement a bidirectional encoder-decoder translation model, employing unsupervised neural network training techniques.

**Global Life Expectancy Analysis (_July 2022_)**
- Conducted in-depth analysis of global life expectancy trends over a 50-year period using Gapminder datasets.
- Employed multiple linear regression analysis, demonstrating a strong positive correlation (R-squared value of 0.75) between GDP and life expectancy.
- Contributed critical insights into the relationship between socioeconomic factors and public health outcomes.

**Object Detection with YOLOv4 (_Jan. 2023_)**
- Developed a custom object detection model using YOLOv4 in Python, achieving an average precision of 0.85.
